Documentation for Programming Assignment 4
==========================================

+------------------------+
| BUILD & RUN (Required) |
+------------------------+

Replace "(Comments?)" with either "32-bit standard Ubuntu 16.04" or "viterbi-scf1.usc.edu".
    The grader should grade my submission on: 32-bit standard Ubuntu 16.04

Replace "(Comments?)" with the command the grader should use to compile your code (should simply be "make pa4").
Please understand that the ONLY acceptable compiler is g++ and each compile command must begin with "g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11".
If you ask the grader to use something else, the grader will not be allowed to comply and you will get a zero for your assignment.
    To compile your code, the grader should type: make pa4

+-------------------------+
| SELF-GRADING (Required) |
+-------------------------+

Replace each "?" below with a numeric value:

(A) neighbors, 2 nodes : 16 out of 16 points
(B) neighbors, 4 nodes : 26 out of 26 points
(C) netgraph, 3 nodes : 30 out of 30 points
(D) netgraph, 4 nodes : 28 out of 28 points

Missing/incomplete required section(s) in README file : -0 pts
Submitted binary file : -0 pts
Cannot compile : -0 pts
"make clean" : -0 pts
Segmentation faults : -0 pts
Freezes : -0 pts
Logging : -0 pts

+---------------------------------+
| BUGS / TESTS TO SKIP (Required) |
+---------------------------------+

Are there are any tests mentioned in the grading guidelines test suite that you
know that it's not working and you don't want the grader to run it at all so you
won't get extra deductions, please replace "(Comments?)" below with your list.
(Of course, if the grader won't run such tests in the plus points section, you
will not get plus points for them; if the garder won't run such tests in the
minus points section, you will lose all the points there.)  If there's nothing
the grader should skip, please replace "(Comments?)" with "none".

Please skip the following tests: NONE

Comments on design decisions: I split up the program into multiple different files.
I hope they make sense!
